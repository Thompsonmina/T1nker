#import "EscrowManager.jsligo" "Contract"

// When this file was created, the smart contract was defined with an entrypoint using `@entry` that was within a namespace. As such, the examples below are written with that assumption in mind.

// IMPORTANT: We suggest always explicitly typing your storage values:
// E.g.: `const storage: int = 10` or `const storage: Contract.[Namespace].storage = 10`

const storage: Contract.EscrowManager.storage= {
    escrow_map: Big_map.empty as Contract.EscrowManager.escrow_map
